# Pushing Leads to Dhisana

After running any tool you can send the results directly to Dhisana for enrichment and automated outreach.

1. In Dhisana create a **Smart List** and choose the **Webhook** option.
2. Copy the webhook URL and generate an API key from the Dhisana dashboard.
3. Open the app **Settings** page and set `DHISANA_WEBHOOK_URL` and `DHISANA_API_KEY` with the values you copied.
4. Run any utility. When results contain LinkedIn profile URLs a **Push to Dhisana AI Contacts** button will appear. Click it to push the leads to Dhisana.

The platform will qualify and research each lead, score them and automatically add them to the correct outreach campaign.
