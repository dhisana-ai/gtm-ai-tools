# Vibe coding new workflows

You can generate utilities right inside the web appâ€”no Codex CLI needed.

1. Launch the Docker container.
2. Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080/utility> in your browser.
3. Click **Create New GTM Utility**.
4. Describe what you want to build and hit **Generate**.
5. Save the tool and use it from the app.
6. Copy the source code if you want to run it elsewhere for automation.

In a few minutes you can describe any GTM workflow and add it to your toolbox without complex or costly setups.

## Example workflow ideas

- Find people by job title at a company.
- Look up people by name and keywords.
- Scrape a custom website for leads.
- Use an LLM to research and summarize a company.
