# Vibe coding new workflows

You can create new GTM utilities directly from the web interface—no Codex CLI required.

1. Launch the Docker container (or deploy with `fly deploy`).
2. Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and any other required keys are set.
3. Open the app and click **Create New GTM Utility**.
4. Describe what you want the utility to do—search, enrich, score, route and more—in natural language.
5. Save the generated tool.
6. Run it like any other utility once the keys are configured.

In a few minutes you can describe any GTM workflow and add it to your toolbox without complex or costly setups.

## Example workflow ideas

- Find people by job title at a company.
- Look up people by name and keywords.
- Scrape a custom website for leads.
- Use an LLM to research and summarize a company.
